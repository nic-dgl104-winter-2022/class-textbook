# Program Structure

Structured programming is one of the several different ways in which a programming language can be constructed. Structured programming was introduced as a way to get away from the “spaghetti code” that was being used in the early days of computer programming. It was also intended to provide a way for programmers to follow code written by other programmers. At low levels, structured programs are composed of simple, hierarchical program flow structures. 

## Basic Structure of a Python Program
### Expressions
An expression is any legal combination of symbols that represents a value. An expression represents something which python evaluates and which produces a value.

### Statements
A Statement is a programming instruction that does something, i.e. some action takes place. A statement executes and may or may not result in a value. 

### Comments
Comments are the additional readable information to clarify the source code. Comments in python are the non-executable statements in which begin with a hash symbol (#) and generally ends with the end of the line. 

### Function
A function is a code that has  a name, and it can be reused (executed again) by specifying its name in the program, where needed. A function begins with a ‘def’ statement.

### Blocks and indentation
A group of statements which are part of another statement, or a function are called block, code-block, or suite in Python. Indentation is used to show blocks in Python. Four spaces together mark the next indent level.

## Basic Structure of a Java Program
__Project package__ ``package helloworld;``
Package is a folder of classes and related files for your project.  ``helloworld`` is the name of the package.
