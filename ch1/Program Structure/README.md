#Program Structure

Structured programming is one of the several different ways in which a programming language can be constructed. Structured programming was introduced as a way to get away from the “spaghetti code” that was being used in the early days of computer programming. It was also intended to provide a way for programmers to follow code written by other programmers. At low levels, structured programs are composed of simple, hierarchical program flow structures. 

##Basic Structure of a Python Program
###Expressions
An expression is any legal combination of symbols that represents a value. An expression represents something which python evaluates and which produces a value.

###Statements
A Statement is a programming instruction that does something, i.e. some action takes place. A statement executes and may or may not result in a value.
