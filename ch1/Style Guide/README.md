Imagine working on a website by yourself. In your head you probably already know how you want it to look. What you are planning to do for the site. And how you are going to lay it out. Now imagine you are working with 5 others on a website. How do you all know what font to use? How do you all know how to strugure each page? What colors are going to be used? Or even what mood or theme you want to portray. That's when a Style Guide comes in handy. A style guide is a document that shows all the important looks, and features for the branding. This documentation allows all other coders to have the same vision. It allows for an easier workflow. Because everyone knows what the website or app will look like, and function like.

## Why Is A Style Guide Important?
A Style guide is important not only for efficient working. But also for brand consistency. Why is brand consistency good? Brand consistency allows marketers to differentiate their product. It allows for a more professional look. As a website or app designer whether you are working alone or for a company. Pleasing the company and their marketers is very beneficial. 

## Important Style Guide Rules

### Company-Wide Access
Although we talked about how important A Style Guide is for yourself and your website team. It is also very important to share the Style Guide with the whole company. Sharing the style guide with the whole company allows a lot more cohesiveness. So the website, branding, social media, and videos all have the same look, tone, theme. And style. This is both beneficial for you creating a website the company will love, and the company themselves.

## Editorial Style Guies VS Visual Style Guides
Let’s first talk about Visual Style Guides. They are used to define a brand look and make sure graphics are consistent and uniform across all platforms. 

Editorial Style Guides include specific rules around the company's voice. This includes tone, grammar, punctuation and abbreviations. 

So while Visual Style Guide is very much about the look of the brand. And the feel the user gets from the look. And the Editorial Style Guide includes the voice and sound of the company. It is very important to include both these when creating a style Guide.

## Style Manuals
