# Naming Conventions

## Intro
Learning to write code can be extremely confusing. There are so many formulas to remember. And if you are off by one capital letter, or one extra letter, your code may not work. With all this learning and memorizing the last thing you want to worry about is Naming your variables, constants, methods, or classes. But believe me. focusing on Naming Conventions at the beginning, will save you in the long run.

## What Is A Naming Convention?
Naming convention is a rule for programmers to follow when naming identifiers like classes, variables, constants, and methods. This rule makes sure every programmer follows the same naming rules. This allows your code to be as clean, and as easy to read as possible.
#### Defintion
>A file naming convention is a framework for naming your files in a way that describes what they contain and how they relate to other files.

## Why Follow Naming Conventions?
Naming Conventions are very important for the readability of your code later on. Not just for you, but for whoever else looks at your code after you. It allows you or anyone else to easily identify the code, and what it does, just off the name. It will save time for both you and the other programmers who look at your code time when editing or making changes to the code you entered. Without the use of consistent naming convention, you and your teammates could be confused by code. In return making it more time consuming for everyone.

### Key Benefits From Following Naming Conventions
- It reduced the amount of effort needed to read and understand the source code.
- It allows more time to focus on other important issues with the code instead of struggling and arguing over naming standards. 

## Naming Conventions For Different Identifiers
To keep things organized. There are different naming conventions used for different identifiers. Here are a few rules to follow when naming specific identifiers.

### Packages
These names should be in lowercase. If you have a small project with only a few packages it’s okay to give them a simple, meaningful name.

#### Example
>Here's an example where the programmer names one package “pokeranalyzer” and the other one “mycalculator” Both these names allow you to understand what they do without seeing the code.
