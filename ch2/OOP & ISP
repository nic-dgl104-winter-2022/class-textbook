# Object-Oriented Programming & Interface Segregation Principle

##Intro

##OOP paradigms
>Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. 
It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), 
which are used to create individual instances of objects. 
There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.
