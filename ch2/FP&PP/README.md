#An Overview of Functional Programming and Functional Paradigms

Here, I will introduce you to functional programming and some of its paradigms. A new and learning programmer may be relucant to learn a different method to achieve the same result, especially when the functional approach can be a difficult approach to understand. However, Functional Programming and its paradigms are best served when software **evolves** over its lifetime, as it was so eloquently put here:

> ```Object-oriented languages are good when you have a fixed set of operations on things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new things. This can be accomplished by adding new classes which implement existing methods, and the existing classes are left alone.

Functional languages are good when you have a fixed set of things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new operations on existing things. This can be accomplished by adding new functions which compute with existing data types, and the existing functions are left alone.```
