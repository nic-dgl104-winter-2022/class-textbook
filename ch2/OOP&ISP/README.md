# Object-Oriented Programming & Interface Segregation Principle
---
Intro

OOP paradigms
>Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. 
It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), 
which are used to create individual instances of objects. 
There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python. 

[What is object-oriented programming? OOP explained in depth By Erin Doherty](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming) 

As illustrated in the picture, we first have a Car class that contains Attributes and Methods. 
Inside Attributes, we got color, brand, year make then witing each attribute we have different values. 
Inside Methods, we have functions that are only accessible to car objects; 
for example, the Repaint method will help us change the car color for each instance  we create; 
the same goes for Tiers upgrade method.



Why should you use OOP
*Opp wil help you simplify your complex structer :relaxed:
*You can use it across programs! :star2:
*You can set class specific behaviour through polymorphism :+1:
*It will make debuging a braze :relieved:
