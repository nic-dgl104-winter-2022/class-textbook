## Chapter 8

**MVC** is known as an architectural pattern, which embodies three parts
Model, View and Controller, or to be more exact it divides the application into
three logical parts: the model part, the view and the controller. It was used
for desktop graphical user interfaces but nowadays is used in designing
mobile apps and web apps.

## History:

MVC was created by Trygve Reenskaug. When he was a visiting scientist at
Xerox Palo Alto Research Laboratory (PARC) in 1978/79, he wrote the initial
reports on MVC. MVC was originally known as "Thing Model View Editor,"
but it was soon changed to "Model View Controller."
Tygrve was designed to address the issue of users controlling a large and
complex data set. MVC as a technique has evolved over the years. The MVC
pattern was first used as an architectural pattern for graphical user interfaces
because it was created before web browsers (GUI).

## MVC Architecture:

MVC is an architectural pattern, which indicates it controls the application's
entire architecture. Even though it is commonly referred to as a design
pattern, we may be wrong if we refer to it entirely as such. Design patterns
are used to solve a specific technical problem, whereas architecture patterns
are used to solve architectural problems, and thus affect the entire
architecture of our application.
It is made up of three primary parts:

‚óè Model

‚óè View

‚óè Controller

each with their own set of responsibilities.

MVC is used for two primary reasons:

‚óè It stops us from repeating ourselves.

‚óè It contributes to the growth of a strong web application framework

</p>

## Model:

It is considered as a low level because it is responsible for data management.
Handle data logically, therefore it's all about data. Because the model is
linked to the database, anything you do with data will be represented in the
model. The model component is where you add or retrieve data. Because the
controller never connects to the database by itself, it reacts to controller
requests. The model interfaces with the database and then provides the
required data to the controller. It's important to note that the model never
directly communicated with the view.

## View:

The view component is in control of data representation. It creates the user
interface, or UI, for the user. So, when you think of a view component in a web
application, only think of the HTML/CSS section. The data acquired by the
model component is used to generate views, but these data are passed
through the controller rather than directly to the view, so the view only
communicates with the controller.

## Controller:

Because the controller is the component that allows the interconnection
between the views and the model, it is known as the "main man." The
controller doesn't have to handle data logic; all it has to do is inform the
model what to do. After getting data from the model, it processes it before
sending it all to the display and explaining how to represent it to the user.
Views and models cannot interact directly.

## KeyPoints:

So MVC isn't easy to understand; in fact, it's really difficult to understand,
but it's not impossible to learn, and every developer should keep it in mind
when designing an application. Keep in mind that MVC is a software
architecture that breaks down your software into smaller pieces.

‚óè The model is concerned with the facts and logic of your system.

‚óè The controller maintains the link between the model and

‚óè the view, while the view only displays data. This 'division' improves
the user experience and modularity while also making testing easier.

## Advantages of MVC:

‚óè The components can be utilised.

‚óè Easy to maintain too.

‚óè In MVC, different components of the application can be published and
  maintained individually.
  
‚óè This architecture helped in the independent testing of components.

## Disadvantages of MVC:

‚óè The level of difficulty is high.

‚óè This product is not suitable for tiny applications.

‚óè In view is the inefficiency of data access.

## MVC EXAMPLE:

Let‚Äôs try to understand the MVC architecture pattern using a very simple android application.
Here we will be building an app for login or authentication. We will be using Kotlin but you
can also use Java.

**Step 1. - Create a new Android Project**

Click on your Android Studio icon and create a new project with an empty activity. You can
name your project anything you like, we named it as MVC Example.

**Step 2. ‚Äì Create three packages**

To implement MVC architecture in this project we have to create three different packages-

**1. Model**

**2. View**

**3. Controller**

Each package will be containing classes and interfaces. To create these package
folders ‚Äì

                    Right Click on the project name > New > Package
             
**Step 3. ‚Äì Create interfaces and classes**

Now, we have to create files and interfaces in the package we created above.
In Model Package create two files-

**iUser.kt**
```
package com.prabhjot.mvcexample.Model
interface iUser {
  fun getEmail(): String?
  fun getPassword(): String?
  fun isValid(): Int
}
```

**User.kt**
```
package com.prabhjot.mvcexample.Model

import android.text.TextUtils
import android.util.Patterns

class User(
    private val email: String?,
    private val password: String?
) : iUser {

    override fun getEmail(): String? {
        return email
    }

    override fun getPassword(): String? {
       return password
    }

    override fun isValid(): Int {
        if (TextUtils.isEmpty(getEmail()))
            return 0
        else if (!Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS.matcher(getEmail()).matches())
            return 1
        else if (TextUtils.isEmpty(getPassword()))
            return 2
        else if (getPassword()?.length!! <= 6)
            return 3
        else
            return -1;
    }
}
```
Now, for the controller package, we have to create one interface iLogin, and a class named as Login.

**iLogin.kt**
```
package com.prabhjot.mvcexample.Controller

interface iLogin {
    fun OnLogin(email: String?, Password: String?)
}
```

**Login.kt**
```
package com.prabhjot.mvcexample.Controller

import com.prabhjot.mvcexample.Model.User
import com.prabhjot.mvcexample.View.LoginView

class Login(
    private val loginView: LoginView
) : iLogin {

    override fun OnLogin(email: String?, password: String?) {
        val user = User(email, password)
        val loginCode = user.isValid()

        when (loginCode) {
            0 -> {
                loginView.OnLoginError("Enter Email");
            }
            1 -> {
                loginView.OnLoginError("Enter a valid Email");
            }
            2 -> {
                loginView.OnLoginError("Enter Password");
            }
            3 -> {
                loginView.OnLoginError("Enter Password greater the 6 char");
            }
            else -> {
                loginView.OnLoginSuccess("You logged in.");
            }
        }

    }
}
```

We are done with model and controller. Now, its time to design UI using View so that data will be displayed in the views.

**LoginView.kt**
```
package com.prabhjot.mvcexample.View

interface LoginView {
    fun OnLoginSuccess(message: String?)
    fun OnLoginError(message: String?)
}
```

**Output ‚Äì**

With this example, we learned how we can implement MVC architecture in an Android App
using Kotlin. Below are some recommended posts by which you can understand MVC
examples more clearly.

## Conclusion:

So MVC isn't easy to understand; in fact, it's really difficult to understand,
but it's not impossible to learn, and every developer should keep it in mind
when designing an application. Keep in mind that MVC is a software
architecture that breaks down your software into smaller pieces. The model
is concerned with the facts and logic of your system. The controller maintains
the link between the model and the view, while the view only displays data.
This 'division' improves the user experience and modularity while also
making testing easier.
