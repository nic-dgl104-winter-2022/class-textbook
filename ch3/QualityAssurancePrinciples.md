# Quality Assurance Principles in Software Development

# A Quick History Lesson
The basis of Quality Assurance and Quality Control – hereafter referred to as “QA” and “QC” respectively – Was set by W. Edward Demings and Joseph M. Juran in Japan shortly after WWII. To the more modern global standards of ISO-9001 there has long been a global standard for QA and QC.

### The Difference Between Quality Control and Quality Assurance:
While the two terms sound very similar they are opposite sides of the same coin - so to speak. \
With Quality Assurance, your goal is to prevent bugs in the first place, through establishing overall guidelines and processes, Quality Control however is the implementation of testing or troubleshooting for when bugs inevitably sneak through. \
In essence Quality Assurance is the first line of defense when creating any piece of software.


# Methods of Quality Assurance

## Failure Testing
One very basic method of Quality assurance is called Failure testing, in which you test a product to determine when and if it fails. In the context of software development, this could mean placing the program in a high usage scenario, perhaps a situation with less resources than the program has been developed on to see if issues arise. \
A hypothetical example being a stressing a program with increasing numbers of requests until errors start to occur.

## Statistical Process Control
Another method of Quality Assurance is Statistical Process Control (SPC) this is a data-driven methodology for improving procedures and software by collecting statistical data from over a period of time and having it analyzed to determine if the program or product meets specifications. \
It also helps eliminate variation from a set standard and helps reduce waste by focusing on early detection and prevention, rather than correction of problems after the fact.


## The PDCA Cycle
One of the most common methods of Quality Assurance is using a continuous improvement model to over a period of time, improve the quality of a product.
```
The PDCA cycle stands for 
1. Plan
    Recognize an opportunity and plan changes to either solve a problem, or improve the program. Define what it is you wish to achieve and plan how you shall go about it.
2. Do
    Implement the plan and begin testing the changes, or begin to determine if the fixes have worked.
3. Check
    Evaluate the results and see if the goal was reached, whether that is improvement or if the problem has been solved.
4. Act
    If there has been no improvement, or the problem was not solved, begin the cycle anew and continue trying to improve the processes with a different approach.
```
The PDCA cycle is fundamental in most cases where a business wants to implement a continuous improvement cycle.

### Pros and Cons of the PDCA cycle:
```
Pros:
It is a simple formula to follow, and if implemented correctly, very powerful.
Helps with problem solving and improvement

Cons:
The process can be rather slow, so if an issue is urgent and needs to be dealt with ASAP it may not be the best approach.
```

## QA Outsourcing
For many businesses, outsourcing Quality Assurance will very likely be one of, if not the most cost-efficient method. \
If quality assurance is outsourced, more than likely you will gain access to QA engineers with years of specialized experience. 
With QA being outsourced, this also will free up internal funds and resources, as you would not need to build a separate QA team or use your current team which may or may not be trained in QA engineering.


# Quality Management Systems
A Quality management system is in essence just the entirety of the documentation of the current QA system along with all processes and procedures written while following a PDCA cycle.

### The ISO
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) publishes international standards for many things, including quality management systems. \
Since there is not a one size fits all guideline for every business type they often publish many different variations, such as "ISO/IEC/IEEE 90003:2018" which are guidelines to the application of "ISO 9001:2015" to software development.

# In Conclusion
Quality Assurance is a vital part of any successful software development organization, with the competitive world of software development you often have one shot to release a product that is of an acceptable quality. In most cases, if your first product is faulty there are often many other choices for a consumer to pick. \
Quality assurance is one part of a whole that will help achieve success in not only mobile app development but in most manufacturing situations.
