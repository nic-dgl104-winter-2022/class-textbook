# How to Assess a User Interface from a Developer's Perspective

## Introduction
While looking at the user interface developers may overlook some components, by doing this it can lead to communication issues between developers and designers. So, in this section the challenges faced during communication will be examined in more depth, to find ways these issues can be avoided from the start. 

## User Interface
[User interface](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/user-interface-UI) plays a huge role in digital development no matter the product.  Since user interface is how the user can interact with the application or website mainly focusing on looks or style. For example, the homepage of a website having the app bar along the top to make it easy to browse the site while also being intuitive. This means the user interface design is the first way the application or website makes an impression on the user.  So being able to have a cohesive, easily operable and aesthetic user interface is of huge importance. 

## Working Together
This means keeping both developers and designers on the same page is the best way to keep a consistent design across all elements of the application. Although sometimes achieving that is more difficult than it sounds. As mentioned by Kathryn Grayson Nanz in [Design Systems for Developers](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/design-systems-developers), many developers tend to tune out when design elements are brought up in conversation. Which can lead to details being missed during [communication]( https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/809/) and will lead to more things needing to be fixed later rather than being done from the start. Another [source](https://opensenselabs.com/blog/articles/communication-designer-developer) of challenges is that although both teams are working on the same project, they each approach the challenge with different mindsets leading to each team having different priorities. Lastly differences in time estimation may pop up, leaving either team frustrated with each other when deadlines were missed if they didn’t leave enough time for the other team.

## Better Communication
A simple way to prevent the challenges from the start is for developers to ask plenty of questions when you receive references from the designer so that developers have a clear picture in mind of their intended design. Another common problem is physical barriers, since some companies tend to view each team as fully separate designers and developers might not actually see each other often. Whereas, if they worked closer in harmony it would be much easier to just go discuss with the other team. Although the new issue since this article was written is many companies have decided to let employees work from home since the climate of today’s world. This means most communication is most likely done over emails or applications such as slack making it harder to fully understand designers’ intention. So possibly a solution to this is to have short video conferences more frequently to help the product be more cohesive when finished. Another unique approach that has been mentioned is having each team learn a bit of the other’s job so the gap between each team is smaller meaning there is mutual understanding on both ends of the project. Lastly when doing important beginning meeting to discuss time frames instead of doing them separately, have both teams do it at the same time so they know exactly what to expect and can offer input if needed. 

There’s also many technologies and different resources that can lay things out more clearly for each team so there’s even less opportunity for communication error. These will be introduced in the next section.
